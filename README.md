### :woman_technologist: ABOUT ME:


🔍 Love to play with Data and AI.

📚 I started studying Data Science and Machine Learning because it was a subject in one of my semesters, but, guess what? Data Science, ML, and AI have become my passion now.

👋 Hello, I am Shashank Kumar Dubey, a final year student pursuing B. Tech in Information Technology (IoT) at Madhav Institute of Technology and Science (MITS), Gwalior. I am working and learning Data Science, Data Analytics, ML, and AI from the last 2 years and worked on various projects that helped me gain hands-on experience. Some of my projects are Indian Sign Language Recognition, Facial Emotion Recognition, and Traffic Sign Recognition.
