### :woman_technologist: ABOUT ME:


🔍 Love to play with Data and AI.

📚 I started studying Data Science and Machine Learning because it was a subject in one of my semesters, but, guess what? Data Science, ML, and AI have become my passion now.

👋 Hello, I am Shashank Kumar Dubey, currently working as a Data Scientist. I specialize in Data Science, Machine Learning, AI, and Generative AI, with hands-on experience in Python, LLMs, LangChain, Advance RAG Architecture, AI Agents and more. I have worked on projects like Conversational Chatbots, Market Research Agents, and Fine-tuning Open-Source and Closed-Source LLMs.
